## Overview

Theme: Earth Day 

I chose the theme Earth Day (or nature) for my Google Doodle project. I chose this concept, because I felt it would allow a lot of flexibility for potential designed. My ideal plan will be grass growing from behind to show the “Google”. For some background, Earth Day is an annual event that takes place on April 22nd. It was first celebrated in 1970. It is expected to be observed by people taking special steps out of the ordinary routine to lessen their impact on the environment. Earth Day is observed in 193 countries as the concern for environmental welfare is increasing. For my design I want to incorporate a Earth along with some other kind of plants or environmental aspects. I want little animations, because I do not want it too look overtly busy. From my research from previous Google doodles, many seem to be still images that are illustrated to show earth, plants, animals, water, and more environmental images. They use earthly, muted tones that symbolize the event of Earth Day and the appreciation of the environment.
